        <h2> HTML </h2>
        <ul>
          <li> HTML is the basic structure of a web app</li>
          <li> An element is a type of content that builds a webpage </li>
          <li> Types of elements used are Text elements, Image elements, Header elements, List elements, Meta related elements, Content Division elements, and Semantic elements.</li>
          <li> The head element: contains metadata that helps render the page correctly, it is not visible to the browser. </li>
          <li> The body element: contains the content shown to the user, all elements to be seen / interacted with belong here </li>
          <li> The body: is a semantic HTML element (name of the element describes its content & role it plays on the webpage) </li>
          <li> div element: creates a division </li>
          <li> br element: creates a break (adds a blank line to break up text, images, or interactables. </li>
          <li> a element: creates an anchor that creates links to other webpages </li>
          <li> href element: points to the url of the link <li>
          <li> img element: allows you to embed pictures onto your webpage </li>
          <li> src: sources the url for the image embeded on your webpage </li>
          <li> ul element: creates an unordered list </li>
          <li> ol element: creates an ordered list </li>
          <li> li element: creates list items for ul and ol </li>

        <h2> CSS </h2>
        <ul>
          <li> CSS makes the base structure of html more visually appealing </li>
          <li> 3 ways of styling a webpage are Inline CSS, Internal CSS style sheet, and External CSS style sheet 
               (most popularly used becuase it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a seperate file) </li>
          <li> style is an attribute/element that effects html elements </li>
          <li> Inline CSS is used inside of an html element such as h1, p, img etc. </li>
          <li> Internal CSS is used in the head element of html </li>
          <li> external CSS style sheet is a seperate file linked to the html file through a link element in the htmls head element </li>
          <li> class/IDs create a class of element to be effected by CSS </li>
          <li> selector: element/attribute to which the rules will apply </li>
          <li> Decleration Block: broken down to 2 important parts the CSS property aswell as the value </li>
          <li> Margin: indicates the room around the element </li>
          <li> Padding creates room inside of element effectively making the element larger </li>
          <li> every html element is a box containing margins on the outside and borders,padding and content on the inside </li>
          <li> Can combine two selectors into one css with a comma this helps write DRY code (do not repeat yourself) </li>
          <li> text-align: aligns text to a designated part of the screen according to the value </li>
          <li> Rel: specifiying relationship between current and lnked element </li>
          <li> link: creates a connection to a external file </li>
          <li> href: specifies location (url) of external resource, it is using a reletive path whcih means the location is derived from the current URL(location) </li>
          <li> a period before a class in style will allow all elements with the same class to be effected at once with CSS </li>
          <li> width: affects the width of element </li>
          <li> border: affects border of element </li>
          <li> box-shadow: applies shadow to element (values of px offset shadow to left/right or top/bottom of element) </li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="git-section"> 
        <h2> Git </h2>
        <ul>
          <li> git status: checks what branch you are currently on </li>
          <li> git check -b branch name: creates a new branch for you to work on and switches it </li>
          <li> git clone: creates a copy of your repo to your machine in the current directory you are in </li>
          <li> git init: creates a new local repo </li>
          <li> git add filename with angle brackets: creates new file with given file name </li>
          <li> git commit -m "commit message": commit changes to head (but not yet to the remote rope) </li>
          <li> git commit -a: commit any files you've added with git add and also commit any files you've changed since then </li>
          <li> git checkout: switched from one branch to another </li>
          <li> git branch: lists all branches in your repo </li>
          <li> git branch -d: deletes the feature branch </li>
          <li> feature branch: is a branch where you can work on files without effecting other people </li>  
          <li> git add: stages your changes to be commited </li>

      <section class="card" id="JavaScript"> 
        <h2> JS </h2>
        <ul> 
          <li> Makes your webapp intelligent making it interactable </li>
          <li> &lt;script&gt; src="where JS file is located"&gt; &lt;script/&gt; creates link between html file and JS file </li>
          <li> Place JS to bottom off html strutcure </li>
          <li> Function-Query Selector () grabs a refrence then stores it in a variable</li>
          <li> Variables are containers that store values you start by declaring the variable with a let or var keyword followed by name you give the variable </li>
          <li> Place semicolon at the end of each statement to close that statement </li>
          <li> You retrieve the value of the variable by calling the name you gave it </li>
          <li> String: A sequence of text needs to be wrapped in '' </li>
          <li> Numbers: Do not need quotes around </li>
          <li> Boolean: True/False statement </li>
          <li> Array: structure that allows you to stire multiple values in a single refrence </li>
          <li> object: can be anything and everything in JS is an oject that can be stores in a variable </li>
          <li> comments are snippits of text not releted to code place // before a comment</li>
          <li>operator: A mathmatical symbol that produces a result based on 2 values </li>
          <li> Addition/Subtraction/Multiplication/Division: Does what you you expect it to do values are +,-,*,/ respectively  </li>
          <li> Assignment: = assigns a value to a variable </li>
          <li> Strict equality: === performs test to see if two values are equal. It returns a Boolean result </li>
          <li> Does-not-equal:!= turns trues into falses and visa versa (returns the logical opposite value) </li>
          <li> Functions are a way of packaging functionality </li>
          <li> Control Flow is the way in which a computer executes code (top to bottom)</li>
          <li> If statement add descion making into our code applies conditional statemnt </li>
          <li> If a value isnt truthy and is falsey the computer will ignore the code between the curly brackets </li>
          <li> JS targets first truthy statemtn and crunches out that value </li>
          <li> for loop: Predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed in a "loop" </li>
          <li> A for loop contains 3 steps: </li>
          <li> 1) find a starting point for the loop var x=0; </li>
          <li> 2) condition as long as x is less than length of the array the code will execute onetime for each item in array x &lt; shapes.length; </li>
          <li> 3) x++ adds one value to x </li>
          <li> function: set of instructions that tells the computer to perform tasks </li>
          <li> functions don't automaticall execute when the JS file is run tou must call to a function by name to execute it - allows your code to be reused and more flexible </li>
          <li> code block = function body </li>
          <li> adding function before naming the funtion decalres that it is a function </li>
          <li> add () after a function to set parameters </li>
          <li> console.log places a written log in the inspect console in chrome </li>
