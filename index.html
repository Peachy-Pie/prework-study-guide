          <li> HTML is the basic structure of a web app</li>

          <li> br element: creates a break (adds a blank line to break up text, images, or interactables. </li>

        <h2> CSS </h2>
        <ul>
          <li> CSS makes the base structure of html more visually appealing </li>
          <li> 3 ways of styling a webpage are Inline CSS, Internal CSS style sheet, and External CSS style sheet 
               (most popularly used becuase it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a seperate file) </li>
          <li> style is an attribute/element that effects html elements </li>
          <li> Inline CSS is used inside of an html element such as h1, p, img etc. </li>
          <li> Internal CSS is used in the head element of html </li>
          <li> external CSS style sheet is a seperate file linked to the html file through a link element in the htmls head element </li>
          <li> class/IDs create a class of element to be effected by CSS </li>
          <li> selector: element/attribute to which the rules will apply </li>
          <li> Decleration Block: broken down to 2 important parts the CSS property aswell as the value </li>
          <li> Margin: indicates the room around the element </li>
          <li> Padding creates room inside of element effectively making the element larger </li>
          <li> every html element is a box containing margins on the outside and borders,padding and content on the inside </li>
          <li> Can combine two selectors into one css with a comma this helps write DRY code (do not repeat yourself) </li>
          <li> text-align: aligns text to a designated part of the screen according to the value </li>
          <li> Rel: specifiying relationship between current and lnked element </li>
          <li> link: creates a connection to a external file </li>
          <li> href: specifies location (url) of external resource, it is using a reletive path whcih means the location is derived from the current URL(location) </li>
          <li> a period before a class in style will allow all elements with the same class to be effected at once with CSS </li>
          <li> width: affects the width of element </li>
          <li> border: affects border of element </li>
          <li> box-shadow: applies shadow to element (values of px offset shadow to left/right or top/bottom of element) </li>
        </ul>
